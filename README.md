**IPL Win Probability Prediction**

**Project Overview**

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular cricket leagues worldwide, drawing millions of fans and generating a huge amount of interest in match predictions. However, the dynamic nature of cricket makes it difficult to accurately predict match outcomes, as various factors influence the results, such as team composition, player performance, batting and bowling strengths, and match conditions.

This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine learning model that predicts the win probability of the chasing team based on crucial features such as batting scores, current run rate, required run rate, and more. The model has been trained using historical IPL match data to ensure reliable predictions.


**Features**

Machine Learning Model: Uses historical IPL data to predict the win probability of the chasing team.
Interactive Streamlit App: A user-friendly web application that allows users to input match-specific data and receive real-time win probability predictions.
Key Predictors: Factors like current run rate, required run rate, batting scores, and other match conditions are taken into account.
Engagement and Insights: Aims to enhance fan engagement and provide valuable insights to cricket analysts and enthusiasts.


**How to Use**

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies from the provided environment.yml file.
Run the Streamlit app using:
streamlit run command
Enter match-specific data through the interactive interface to get the predicted win probability for the chasing team.


**Data**

The model is trained using IPL match data, focusing on the factors that significantly impact the outcome of a match. The data includes details like match scores, run rates, and other relevant match conditions.


**Technologies Used**

Python: For data processing, model training, and deployment.
Streamlit: For creating the interactive web app.
scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
